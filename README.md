# Syrian Conflict Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Kaggle notebook that performs sentiment analysis on social media posts related to the Syrian conflict. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including VADER sentiment analysis, to analyze over 5,000 posts. It also incorporates data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent sentiment trends and key insights.

## Overview

The dataset consists of social media posts related to the Syrian conflict, and the goal of this analysis is to:

- Extract sentiment scores (positive, neutral, and negative) from the posts.
- Visualize the sentiment over time to observe trends in public perception.
- Explore potential correlations between sentiment and specific events or periods in the conflict.
